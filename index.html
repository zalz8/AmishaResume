                    <p>In 2022, I had the opportunity to work with the Reserve Bank of India as a UX researcher. During my time there, I was tasked with working on a project that involved conducting a comparative analysis of India's leading mobile banking apps. This project was particularly interesting, as it involved examining the user experience of each app and identifying areas for improvement. Through this project, I was able to gain valuable insights into the needs and preferences of mobile banking users in India, and provide recommendations to help improve the overall user experience of these apps. Working with the Reserve Bank of India was a great experience, and I am proud to have been a part of such an important project.</p>
